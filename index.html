                <p>- Stack flat, but not too flat, to allow S and Z tetrominoes to stack without creating gaps. Having a
                    flat field will allow a player to rotate less, which saves time. A player will also have more
                    placement opportunities. The even field will allow a player to think less which results in faster
                    reaction times. Also, stacking flat will also mean keeping middle columns lower to the ground,
                    lessening the risk of a block-out.</p>
                <p>- Try not to build empty columns greater than 2 cells deep, as this will require an I tetromino that
                    can be better used to tetris.</p>
                <p>- Use a T to convert an S/Z field position into a Z/S.</p>
                <p>- Avoid placing a J upright towards the left wall if you don't expect another J to appear soon. The
                    same idea applies to L tetrominoes, either at a wall or at the edge</p>
                <p>- When dealing with a two-deep hole, make room for both J and L instead of blocking one off.</p>
                <p>- When having two open columns, deal with it as soon as possible. Over stacking will make things
                    worse by having to wait on even more l shapes.</p>
